## [Bloc Jams](http://mehtaculous.github.io/bloc-jams/index.html): a digital music player like Spotify that I used to learn frontend web development

**Bloc Jams** allows for users to listen to their favorite tracks on the go or in the comfort of their own home, with no arbitrary limits or distractions. I started off by building the backbone of the application layout with HTML, added styling and responsiveness using CSS, and implemented interactivity with JavaScript.
